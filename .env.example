# Example environment variables file
# Copy this to .env and add your API keys (NEVER commit .env to git!)

# Translation API Keys (optional - only needed for DeepL or Google Cloud Translation)
# Get DeepL free API key: https://www.deepl.com/pro-api (500k chars/month free)
# Get Google Cloud Translation API key: https://cloud.google.com/translate

# DeepL API Key (optional)
DEEPL_API_KEY=your-deepl-api-key-here

# Google Cloud Translation API Key (optional)
GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here

# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# 1. NEVER commit .env file to git (it's in .gitignore)
# 2. NEVER hardcode API keys in source code
# 3. For client-side apps (like this one), users provide their own keys via UI
# 4. For server-side backend, load keys from environment variables only
